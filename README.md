## Project Overview:
This project aims to develop and automate vesicle manufacturing for synthetic biology applications. We focus on producing monodisperse, unilamellar vesicles on-site and on-demand with high reproducibility. The system uses computational metrology, a method that measures models rather than physical objects, ensuring predictable vesicle formation under varied conditions.

## Objectives:
1. **Biological**: Create predictable vesicles for building synthetic cells.
2. **Democratization**: Build a low-cost system (under $10k) to make this technology accessible to non-expert users.
3. **Automation**: Implement high-level control loops for lab automation and synthetic cell production.

## Key Challenges:
- **Instrumentation and Measurement**: The need to quickly change chemical compositions in synthetic cells and test variants.
- **Vesicle Standardization**: Developing tools and protocols for reproducible vesicle production.
- **Automation**: Controlling fluid inputs in microfluidic droplet generation to achieve consistent droplet size.
- **Reproducibility**: Addressing the problem of inconsistent results across labs using microfluidic platforms.
  
## Proposed Solutions:
- **Task for Automation System**: Adjust fluid flows to produce consistent droplet sizes.
- **Low-Cost System**: Build an integrated system using <$10k lasers, resin printers, and automatic tool-changing milling machines.
- **Controller-less Machines**: Each sensor, motor, and actuator will act as a node on a real-time network, simplifying control of high-level loops and allowing easy integration of additional components.
  
## Deliverables:
1. **Predictable Vesicles**: Tools and protocols for consistent vesicle formation for synthetic cell construction.
2. **Democratized Techniques**: A <$10k microfluidic fabrication system with documentation for broad accessibility.
3. **Automation Tools**: Optical sorting of vesicles using an LED and Raspberry Pi camera system.

## Timeline:
- **Spring 2025**: Demonstration of the integrated system.
- **Completion**: A full year after the demonstration, the project is expected to be finalized.

## Communication:
- **Technical Lead**: Marcus Fletcher, email: m.fletcher@imperial.ac.uk (cc Carlise for admin support).
- **Collaboration**: Shared documents will be provided for collaborative work. Slow specification meetings will be followed by a sprint for system integration and demonstration.

## Discussion Points:
- Repurposing existing instrumentation for vesicle manufacturing.
- Distributed control systems for real-time online adaptation.
- Assay development and standardization.
- Multiband light microscopy for vesicle characterization.
- Challenges in coupling microfluidics with fluid handling systems.

## Future Prospects:
The project may include instructional components on growing (almost) anything, aiming to further integrate synthetic biology techniques into educational settings.
