## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Automate vesicle manufacturing for synthetic biology applications, with a focus on producing monodisperse, unilamellar vesicles on-site and on-demand.
- **Challenge**: Ensure vesicle characterization within 30 minutes of production and extend it if kept cold.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Predictable vesicles for building synthetic cells.
  - Democratizing techniques to make vesicle production accessible with a $10k budget.
  - High-level automation control loops for bioproduction and synthetic biology.

## Technical Needs
- **Instrumentation Needs**: 
  - Need to quickly change the chemical composition of synthetic cells to test variants.
  - Require standardized tools and protocols for vesicle manufacturing.
  - Address reproducibility issues in different labs using microfluidic platforms.
  - Vesicle manufacturing must be on-site and on-demand with monodispersity in vesicle size.
- **Automation Task**: 
  - Dial fluid flows to generate consistent droplets of a desired size.
  - Automate reproducible, predictable droplet generation in varying conditions.
  
## Hardware and Tools
- **Controller-less Machines**: 
  - Every sensor, motor, and actuator is a node on a real-time network, simplifying control of high-level loops.
  - Easy to add more degrees of freedom by integrating them into the network.
- **Microfluidic Chip**: 
  - Develop a low-cost (<$10k) system for microfluidic fabrication using lasers, automatic tool-changing milling machines, and resin printers.
  - Use liquid handlers to pipette/dispense fluid into microfluidic wells, reducing tubing and dead volume.
  
## Future Deliverables
- **Optical Sorting System**: 
  - Design an LED, Raspberry Pi camera system for optical sorting of vesicles.
- **Documentation**: 
  - Document how to build an under $10k system for microfluidic fabrication and vesicle production.
- **Class Module**: 
  - Potentially include a class module on how to grow (almost) anything for educational purposes.

## Reproducibility and Characterization
- **Reproducibility Challenge**: 
  - Problems with microfluidic-based platforms in different labs and the difficulty of reproducing protocols across different environments.
- **Characterization**: 
  - Vesicle manufacturing must include quick characterization, within 30 minutes of production or longer if kept cold.
  - How good is "good enough" for research versus applications? E.g., how strict should vesicle size rejection be in a flow system?

## Experimental Discussions
- **Wafer Tweezer for Synthetic Cells**: 
  - Propose new devices rather than modular parts for more efficient production.
- **Encapsulation Task**: 
  - Task for the automation system: Encapsulate a cell-free system to make GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein).
- **Distributed Control Systems**: 
  - Focus on real-time online adaptation for controlling multiple quantities in a cell-free reaction system.
  
## Key Discussions
- **Challenges**:
  - How to interface with fluidics upstream?
  - Consider piezo loading or positive pressure for loading fluid into the microfluidics.
  - Neil raised the question of balancing the need for motion systems versus fluidics.

## Timeline and Collaboration
- **Timeline**:
  - Demonstration scheduled for **Spring 2025** with project completion a year from now.
- **Collaboration**:
  - Marcus is the **technical lead**, with Carlise handling **administration**.
  - Shared documents will be set up for collaborative work.
  - Everyone should email **Kate** for updates and queries.
  - **Slow specification meetings** followed by a sprint for system integration and demonstration.
